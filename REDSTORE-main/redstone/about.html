    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p id="Abcde">Google LLC (/ˈɡuːɡəl/ (listen)) is an American multinational technology company that focuses on search engine
        technology, online advertising, cloud computing, computer software, quantum computing, e-commerce, artificial
        intelligence,[9] and consumer electronics. It has been referred to as the "most powerful company in the
        world"[10] and one of the world's most valuable brands due to its market dominance, data collection, and
        technological advantages in the area of artificial intelligence.[11][12][13] It is considered one of the Big
        Five American information technology companies, alongside Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft.
        <br>
        <br>

        Google was founded on September 4, 1998, by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were PhD students at Stanford
        University in California. Together they own about 14% of its publicly listed shares and control 56% of the
        stockholder voting power through super-voting stock. The company went public via an initial public offering
        (IPO) in 2004. In 2015, Google was reorganized as a wholly owned subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. Google is
        Alphabet's largest subsidiary and is a holding company for Alphabet's Internet properties and interests. Sundar
        Pichai was appointed CEO of Google on October 24, 2015, replacing Larry Page, who became the CEO of Alphabet. On
        December 3, 2019, Pichai also became the CEO of Alphabet.[14]
        <br>
        <br>

        The company has since rapidly grown to offer a multitude of products and services beyond Google Search, many of
        which hold dominant market positions. These products address a wide range of use cases, including email (Gmail),
        navigation (Maps), cloud computing (Cloud), web browsing (Chrome), video sharing (YouTube), productivity
        (Workspace), operating systems (Android), cloud storage (Drive), language translation (Translate), photo storage
        (Photo), video calling (Meet), smart home (Nest), smartphones (Pixel), wearable technology (Fitbit), gaming
        (Stadia), music streaming (YouTube Music), video on demand (TV), artificial intelligence (Assistant), machine
        learning APIs (TensorFlow), AI chips (TPU), and more. Discontinued Google products include Glass, Google+,
        Reader, Play Music, Nexus, Hangouts, and Inbox by Gmail.[15][16]
        <br>
        <br>

        Google strives for ambitious technological innovations aimed at solving humanity's biggest problems.[17] Some of
        these include quantum computing (Sycamore), self-driving cars (Waymo, formerly the Google Self-Driving Car
        Project), smart cities (Sidewalk Labs), and transformer models (Google Brain).[18]
        <br>
        <br>

        Google and YouTube are the two most visited websites worldwide followed by Facebook and Twitter. Google is also
        the largest search engine, mapping and navigation application, email provider, office suite, video sharing
        platform, photo and cloud storage provider, mobile operating system, web browser, ML framework, and AI virtual
        assistant provider in the world as measured by market share. On the list of most valuable brands, Google is
        ranked second by Forbes[19] and fourth by Interbrand.[20] It has received significant criticism involving issues
        such as privacy concerns, tax avoidance, censorship, search neutrality, antitrust and abuse of its monopoly
        position.</p>
